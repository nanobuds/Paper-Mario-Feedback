Post issues/suggestions as they arise

PLEASE DON'T POST ANYTHING ABOUT THE PAPER LUIGI OR PAPER DR MARIO ALTS!! These are both private info, so no spoilers allowed!!

Please try looking for the following things:
- Any partner animations where some meshes are showing which shouldn't be there (main ones to look out for would be Goombario speech bubbles)
- Any situations where the partners can be damaged and die (this should never happen!)
- Try breaking the partner abilities! Their implementations are complex, so they're bound to break, so let's do it now!
- Try messing up the constraints between Paper Mario and the partners by hitting Paper Mario during the abilities where they are connected and work together (like both Flurrie's abilities)
- Are there any Paper Mario moves that cancel the partner abilities that work on their own (like Lady Bow)? The ones we found and fixed only canceled the abilities when Paper Mario was near the partner
- Do the partners ever die if they're too far from Paper Mario from too long? There was a fix added for this, but is a little under tested
- Any visual bugs with the N64, Paper Luigi or Paper Dr. Mario alts?
- Any lag while multiple Paper Mario's are in the game? 
- Any animations look bad with Paper Luigi? Mostly watch his feet, they may "float" from his body. He already has some custom animations to fix this, but I may have missed some.

Known Bugs/issues:
- Final Smash doesn't do anything
- Lots of missing sound effects
- Paper Luigi doesn't have a unique voice yet
- Missing alt skins for some of the partners
